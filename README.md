# micropython-esp32-pwm

pwm (pulse with modulation) on esp32 with micropython, so we can generated pwm signal with micropython.

what we need?

-ESP32 with micropython

-Osciloscope/Multimeter suppor Duty cycle calculation

-LED 

by using pwm on esp32 we can make another projects like buck converter or boost converter, so it's jus basic to know how to make pulse modulation on esp32 with micropython
